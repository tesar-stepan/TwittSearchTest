# TwittSearchTest
Test project connecting Play Framework to Twitter API.

This project uses the Play Framework with Java as the back-end language, and was developed using ItelliJ IDEA.
UI Designed using bootstrap. Some small effort went into optimising for mobile (but not beyond bootstrap grid system and few lines of own css).
For demonstartional purposes only, but if you stumble upon it, do whatever you want with it.

- The Play 2 Framework crew for good tutorials and examples.
- All of Stackoverflow community for everything that the tutorials do not cover. You are awesome. 

This was my first project using the Play framework, so I might have missed few good practices. Sorry if there is anything too unusual in the code.
